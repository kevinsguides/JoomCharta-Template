TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_PRIMARY_LABEL="Primary Color"

TPL_JOOMCHARTA_CUSTOM_COLORS_LABEL="Custom Colors"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_CUSTOM_COLORS_DESC="If you decide to use custom colors, make sure you pick good ones. The primary color should be dark enough that white text can be clearly seen on top of it. The secondary color should do the same, but compliment the primary color in some way. I would suggest using a link that's just slightly lighter than the primary color, or go with the traditional blue."

TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_MODE_NOTE_LABEL="Color Mode Notice"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_MODE_NOTE_DESC="This mode will use the user's device settings to determine if it should load dark or light mode. Then, the user may manually change using a toggle icon at the bottom of the site. <br/><strong>Note that doing this may require you to test all areas of your site in dark <em>and</em> light mode to ensure everything looks good.</strong> You have to make sure all your extensions and media look good in both modes. This could take a significant amount of time. If you don't want to deal with this, I'd suggest sticking with either dark OR light mode."
