TPL_JOOMCHARTA_LAYOUT_ULTRAWIDE_LABEL="Support Ultrawide Breakpoint"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_LAYOUT_ULTRAWIDE_DESC="If you want to support the ultrawide breakpoint, check this box. The template will use a new breakpoint for screens wider than 2000px."
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_PRIMARY_LABEL="Primary Color"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_PRIMARY_DESC="Override the default primary color (used in header and many Bootstrap components). Darker colors work best."
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_CUSTOM_COLORS_LABEL="Custom Colors"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_CUSTOM_COLORS_DESC="If you decide to use custom colors, make sure you pick good ones! Also, you should probably pick either dedicated DARK or LIGHT mode. Don't use both. The primary color should be dark enough that white text can be clearly seen on top of it. The secondary color should do the same, but compliment the primary color in some way. I would suggest using a link that's just slightly lighter than the primary color, or go with the traditional blue."
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_SECONDARY_LABEL="Secondary Color"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_SECONDARY_DESC="Pick a color that nicely compliments the first"

COM_TEMPLATES_STYLE_FIELDSET_LABEL="Style Settings"

TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_MODE_NOTE_LABEL="Color Mode Notice"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_MODE_NOTE_DESC="This mode will use the user's device settings to determine if it should load dark or light mode. Then, the user may manually change using a toggle icon at the bottom of the site. <br/><strong>Note that doing this may require you to test all areas of your site in dark <em>and</em> light mode to ensure everything looks good.</strong> You have to make sure all your extensions and media look good in both modes. This could take a significant amount of time. If you don't want to deal with this, I'd suggest sticking with either dark OR light mode."

TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_MODE_TOGGLE_LABEL="Show Color Toggle Button"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_COLOR_MODE_TOGGLE_DESC="If yes, the toggle button will be displayed and users can change color mode at any time. If no, the toggle icon will be hidden and dark or light mode will be loaded based only on the user system preference. If no, remember, your site will still show up in dark or light mode for certain users. Both themes will be activated, but it will be more difficult for users to switch and for you to test."

TPL_JOOMCHARTA_HEADER_STYLE_LABEL="Header Style"
TPL_JOOMCHARTA_HEADER_STYLE_DESC="Choose between site title, full width image, logo image, or header module. Full width image should be a photo that stretches across the entire container.
